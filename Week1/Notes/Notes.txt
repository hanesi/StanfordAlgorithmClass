Karatsuba Multiplication

Ex: Multiply 1234 * 5678
Sequence looks different than grade school multiplication

x = 1234
y = 5678

a = 56, b = 78, c = 12, d = 34
do a few operations between those 2 digit numbers and collect.

1) compute a * c
2) compute b * d
3) compute (a +b)(c +d)
4) compute Step 3 - 2 - 1
5) pad a * c with 4 0's, b * d with none, Step 4 with 0, add them up

x * y = 10^n(ac) + 10^(n/2)(ad + bc) + bc

only care about 3 quantities, so only want 3 recursive calls

1) compute ac
2) compute bd
3) recursively compute (a+b)(c+d) = ac+ad+bc+bd
Gauss' Trick: 3 - 1 - 2 = ad + bc
upshot: only need 3 recursive calls and some additions


Merge Sort

Good intro to divide and conquer
  improves over selection, insertion, and bubble sorts (O(n)^2)

Sorting problem:
Input: array of n numbers, unsorted
Output: array sorted in increasing order
>>>5,4,1,3,2,7,9
>>>1,2,3,4,5,7,9

Merge Sort - recursive, calls itself on smaller arrays than the input
Split array into 2, sort each, combine them (merge)
